**🛒 Ecommerce Sales Data Analysis**

Welcome to my Ecommerce Sales Data Analysis project, where I've leveraged Python and MySQL to explore and analyze sales data from an ecommerce platform. 
This project is a comprehensive dive into data-driven insights, covering everything from basic data retrieval to advanced analytics.

📝 Overview

In this project, I've conducted a series of SQL queries categorized into three levels of complexity: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced. 
Each level progressively builds on the previous one, enabling deeper insights into the dataset.
Here's a glimpse of what I worked on:

🔍 Basic Queries
	1. Unique Customer Locations: Listed all unique cities where customers are located.
	2. Order Count: Counted the number of orders placed in 2017.
	3. Sales by Category: Computed the total sales for each product category.
	4. Installment Payments: Calculated the percentage of orders paid via installments.
	5. State-wise Customer Count: Counted the number of customers from each state.
📊 Intermediate Queries
	1. Monthly Order Analysis (2018): Determined the number of orders per month for the year 2018.
	2. Product Order Averages: Calculated the average number of products per order, grouped by customer city.
	3. Revenue Distribution by Category: Computed the percentage of total revenue contributed by each product category.
	4. Price vs Purchase Frequency: Identified the correlation between product price and the frequency of purchases.
	5. Seller Revenue Ranking: Calculated the total revenue generated by each seller and ranked them accordingly.
🚀 Advanced Queries
	1. Customer Order Value Moving Average: Calculated the moving average of order values for each customer over their order history.
	2. Cumulative Monthly Sales: Computed the cumulative sales per month for each year.
	3. Year-over-Year Growth: Analyzed the year-over-year growth rate of total sales.
	4. Customer Retention Rate: Measured the retention rate of customers, defined as the percentage of customers who made another purchase within 6 months of their initial purchase.
	5. Top Spending Customers: Identified the top 3 customers with the highest spending for each year.
 
🚀 Technologies Used
	• Python: For data manipulation and analysis.
	• MySQL: For executing queries and managing the database.

🗂️ Project Structure
	• Scripts: Contains the Python scripts used for executing the MySQL queries and performing additional analysis.
	• Data: I have used E-Commerce sales dataset for this project which i have downloaded from kaggle.com.
	• Results: Contains the output of queries and visualizations created.
📈 Insights
This project allowed me to extract valuable insights from the dataset, such as identifying high-value customers, analyzing sales trends, 
and understanding the impact of pricing on product demand. The advanced queries, in particular, provided deep insights into customer behavior and sales performance over time.
